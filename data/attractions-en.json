      "introduction": "Chiang Kai-shek Shilin Residence\r\nThe former official residence of Chiang Kai-shek and Madam Chiang maintains a quiet and attractive garden. The garden is full of plums, chrysanthemums and roses favored by the Chiang couple. Flowers bloom according to season and make for a stunning view throughout much of the year.\r\n\r\nChiang Kai-shek Shilin Residence Park\r\nhe CKS Shilin Residence Park is located in Shilin District, to the southeast of where Section 5, Zhongshan N. Road and Fulin Road meet. Surrounded by the Fushan hills, this 9.28-hectare park was named after the late R.O.C. President Chiang Kai-shek, who lived on its premises in 1950. It has well-preserved, enchanting scenic resources both in the outer and inner gardens, the principal room, the greenhouse for potted orchids, the rose garden, Victory Chapel, the New Orchid Pavilion and the Ciyun Pavilion, due to construction projects or renovations having been prohibited in the neighborhood for national security reasons. The Chinese-style inner garden is landscaped with a stream running under an artificial bridge, rock gardens, peculiarly shaped rocks, and a red-painted Chinese summerhouse, whereas the European-style outer garden with carpet bed of exuberant flowers, serves as a theme venue for the annual chrysanthemum exhibitions. The rose garden features 200 species and 4,000-odd plants with roses of varied hues during the peak blooming period from November through April, and was Madame Chiang&rsquo;s favorite location for leisurely strolls. While the Chiang family was baptized in a Christian ceremony and held worship services in the Victory Chapel, the New Orchid Pavilion (aka Longevity Pavilion) is a Chinese-style quadrangular structure built in 1950 to host Mr. Chiang&rsquo;s birthday celebrations; it also serves as a venue for various orchid shows. On Mt. Fushan is the Ciyun Pavilion, a two-story square summerhouse built in memory of Mr. Chiang&rsquo;s mother. After being open to the public in 1996, the CKS Shilin Residence Park has undergone many continued renovation projects to become a scenic, recreational spot in downtown Taipei with enhanced quality and quantity of services, besides brilliant zoning and construction plans.",

      "introduction": "The 6.6-hectares Songshan Cultural and Creative Park in Taipei&rsquo;s Xinyi District was completed in 1937 as the Songshan Tobacco Factory, which was one of the seed companies of a monopoly system mandated by the Taiwan Governor-General Office. The premises were one of Taiwan&rsquo;s pioneers of modern industry, as well as the first professional tobacco plant. A gracefully simple Japanese modernist structure, the factory features meticulously crafted face cams, glasswork and bronze nails that made it arguably a &ldquo;model factory&rdquo; at that time. When Japan lost the war in 1945, the Taiwan Provincial Monopoly Bureau took over the factory and renamed it, Songshan Tobacco Factory of Taiwan Provincial Monopoly Bureau. The factory ceased production of cigarettes in 1998 for concerns over urban planning, regulatory changes in the tobacco and liquor marketing system, as well as shrinking demand. It became a relic of the past after being merged into the Taipei Cigarette Plant.\r\n\r\nIn 2001, the Taipei City Government named the tobacco factory the city&rsquo;s 99th historic site and converted it into a park comprising city-designated historic sites (namely the office building, the 1st to 5th warehouses, cigarette plant and boiler room), historic structures (the inspection room, a machinery repair shed and a nursing room) and architectural highlights (the Baroque-style garden, an ecologically landscaped pond, a public bath and a multi-purpose auditorium). For more efficient reuse of space, the Songshan Cultural and Creative Park was built on the historic site as a production base for designers and cultural &amp; creative businesses, as well as a venue for performances and exhibitions. The park introduced to its premises a Taiwan Design Museum and TMSK through partnerships with the Taiwan Design Center and prestigious Taiwanese glasswork label LIULI GONG FANG, respectively, besides a snack bar that was converted from the machinery repair shed.",

      "introduction": "At a corner in Taipei&rsquo;s high-end Xinyi District, a few low-rise houses sit closely together. These somewhat crowded buildings chronicled the tears and joy of veterans who migrated to Taiwan in the early days. This is the former site of Taipei City&rsquo;s Military Dependents&rsquo; Village, called the &ldquo;Sisinan Village&rdquo;.\r\n\r\nWith the increasingly fast economic growth and the rising living standard, these old houses no longer serve the needs of the residents. The City Government initially planned to rebuild them in 1999. However, through persuasion from the cultural circles, the City Government designated this premise as the Cultural Hall and Cultural Park of Xinyi District, and started operation in 2003.\r\n\r\nThe Hall consists of four symmetrical buildings. The houses that sat tightly next to each other have been converted into an open space for events and exhibitions. The premise now consists of an exhibition hall, Military Dependents&rsquo; Village Exhibition Hall, performance hall and community hall. The exterior still retains the unique low-rise and the simple, rustic style of the Military Dependents&rsquo; Village. The narrow alleys and footpaths will take the visitors down memory lane. It is a fascinating contrast to the neighboring towering Taipei 101 and surrounding modern buildings, a compelling testimony of Taipei&rsquo;s urban development.",

The Baishihu Community on the other side of the bridge boasts a 100-meter Chunqiu Footpath that greets visitors with an ingeniously and professionally engineered horticultural area, besides the unique scenic and ecological resources of farms that produce organic vegetables and strawberries.\r\n\r\nAreas around the suspension bridge, including the temple yards, orchards, forest footpath and the lake-strewn wetland, provide terrific places to enjoy blooming flowers and chirping birds.

At the Ch&rsquo;ien Mu House, every detail of the garden, such as the footpath lined with maple trees and rows of bamboo, is a result of years of tireless horticultural efforts by Mrs. Ch&rsquo;ien.\r\n\r\nMr. Ch&rsquo;ien was constantly giving lectures in Taiwan and has attracted a loyal group of followers, including college professors, who have visited the Sushu Building for 20 consecutive years along with their students on outings. An empowering and charismatic speaker, Mr. Ch&rsquo;ien impressed his ever-packed audience with the amazing nuances of Chinese culture.\r\n\r\nA few months after moving out of his 22-year residence at age 96, Mr. Ch&rsquo;ien died; the Sushu Building was left untended for years until it was reopened on Jan. 6, 1992 by the Taipei Public Library as a memorial hall. It was then renovated by the city government in 2001. Taipei City&rsquo;s Department of Cultural Affairs renamed Sushu Building on Dec. 31, 2001 as &ldquo;The Ch&rsquo;ien Mu House&rdquo; and handed it over to Soochow University for management.

Once the summer getaway home for the master of cursive calligraphy of the generation, Yu You-ren, it is now a municipal historic building. The Japanese timber framing-style architecture features a common RC air raid shelter used in the early stage of the Pacific War. The enclosing walls of the courtyard adopted a battlement structure. The backyard is tree-shaded, verdant and luxuriant, overlooking Beitou River with murmuring water, and on the pillar beside the entrance, you&rsquo;ll see the calligraphy inscription &ldquo;Plum Garden&rdquo; by Yu You-ren.\r\n\r\nThe Plum Garden is a Japanese residential building that witnessed the war era. It was built on a sloped terrain and has an upper and a lower floor. The upper floor faces Zhongshan Road. The fa&ccedil;ade, with Japanese timber framing, is on the ground floor level. Research on the construction work on the wall reveals that it is a moisture-proof partition mortar wall. The interior layer of the timber frames is troweled with red mud and sand, while the outside is decorated with white mortar. The building&rsquo;s external features a masoned base, fish scale sidings, black tiles, and wooden window lattices. The lower floor is built with reinforced concrete and is used as an air raid shelter; it leads straight to the backyard. The Japanese building structure and underground air raid shelter trench echo the large air raid shelter trench right across; its special meanings fills it with historic value.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n",
